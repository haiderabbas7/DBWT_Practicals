## Project overview

In this module, DBWT (Database and Web Technologies), I have made my first real contact with web development technologies. I have learned PHP, SQL, and databases from scratch. Additionally, I have used sessions and cookies, explored the MVC pattern, and had an introduction to Laravel.

## Technologies used

- **PHP**: Backend programming language
- **MariaDB**: Database management
- **Laravel**: Web application framework
